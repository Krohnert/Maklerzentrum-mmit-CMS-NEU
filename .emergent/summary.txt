The trajectory details a multi-phase development effort for the Maklerzentrum Schweiz AG website. Initially, the AI engineer was tasked with summarizing previous work and continuing development. The first major user request involved duplicating the existing React/FastAPI application () into a new version () to allow parallel development, which was successfully accomplished with separate configurations and supervisor scripts.

Following this, the user requested converting the application to HTML5. The AI engineer successfully translated the core frontend pages, including the home page, forms, and SEO elements, into a static HTML5 structure within a new  directory. This involved manual porting of JSX content and styling.

A subsequent critical request from the user outlined a comprehensive Headless CMS integration strategy using Directus Cloud. Despite an initial attempt to use Docker for Directus (which failed due to the environment), the AI engineer pivoted to implementing a local mock-CMS system within the  directory, complete with mock data, a  rendering logic, and a basic admin interface. This was later relocated to  after the  directory mysteriously disappeared, causing a brief debugging phase.

Most recently, the user provided detailed requirements for legal text management (Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB) via the CMS, consent banner implementation, security enhancements (headers, form security), and GEO-SEO. The AI engineer began by structuring the mock CMS data for legal content and creating the necessary HTML pages and JavaScript modules. The very last user request is to fetch specific Impressum and AGB content from an external URL and implement page auto-scrolling on navigation.

The overarching goal is a fast, mobile-first German website for Maklerzentrum Schweiz AG to drive VBV course reservations. Key branding elements include Keine halben Sachen., primary color #D81C1C, and Inter typography. Core features involve a sticky header with navigation, Platz sichern CTA, Anmelden link to an external platform, and a detailed footer. Pages include Home (badges, H1, video, 3-step reservation, modules, prices, testimonials, FAQ), Schulung, Services, About Us, Kontakt, and legal/confirmation pages (AGB, Impressum, Datenschutz, Danke). Forms for Reservierung and Firmenklasse anfragen submit to . Non-functional requirements emphasize mobile-first design, SEO (meta, JSON-LD, robots.txt, sitemap), performance, accessibility, favicon, and specific button styling.

Recent additions include duplicating the original React/FastAPI app, converting the frontend to static HTML5, and implementing a mock Headless CMS for dynamic content management. The latest requirements focus on making legal texts (Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB) fully CMS-editable, integrating a consent banner, enhancing security with HTTP headers and secure forms, and implementing GEO-SEO features, while maintaining existing navigation structure.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture (Original App):** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB.
- **UI/Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components.
- **Frontend Development:** React Router DOM, , , .
- **Static Site Generation:** Manual HTML5 conversion.
- **Headless CMS (Mock/Target):** Directus Cloud (target), local JSON/JavaScript (mock).
- **Security & Compliance:** Consent management, DOMPurify for HTML sanitization, HTTP Security Headers.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**
- ****: FastAPI backend, handles API routes. Remains mostly untouched, except for V2 modifications.
- ****: Original React frontend (now mostly duplicated in  and largely superseded by HTML5 efforts).
- ****: The main HTML5 landing page. Has been populated with content from the React Home page, booking form, footer, SEO schema, and is now being integrated with CMS markups for dynamic content.
- **, , **: New HTML5 pages dedicated to legal texts, designed to render content dynamically from the mock CMS.
- ****: A newly created local administrative interface for the mock CMS, allowing management of content like testimonials, FAQ, team, and events.
- ****: Core JavaScript for fetching and rendering content from the local mock CMS into the HTML pages using  attributes.
- **, , , , **: Modular JavaScript files being developed to support various aspects of the CMS integration, consent management, HTML rendering, and sanitization.
- ** & **: Local JSON files acting as the mock CMS's data store, particularly for  (including legal texts) and  (footer/mobile legal links).
- **, **: SEO configuration files, updated to reflect the new HTML5 structure and legal pages.
- ****: A new file for security contact information, part of the security enhancements.
- ****: A complete duplicate of the initial  structure, configured to run independently on different ports and use a separate database. This was created to allow for experimental changes without affecting the original.

<pending_tasks>
- **Backend Forms Integration:** Connect  and  with the FastAPI backend for email sending.
- **SSR Implementation for SEO:** Address  limitation for full meta-tag injection (originally for React app, likely still relevant for dynamic HTML5 content).
- **External Image Hosting:** Migrate external image URLs (team photos).
- **Dynamic Domain URLs:** Replace hardcoded domain URLs in JSON-LD schemas.
- **Google Search Console & Business Profile Setup:** Configure these.
- **Full Directus Cloud Integration:** Migrate the local mock CMS to Directus Cloud.
- **Implement reCAPTCHA and Honeypot for Forms:** For security.
- **Implement Rate Limiting for Forms:** For security.
- **Implement Form Logging without PII:** For security.
- **Full GEO-SEO Implementation:** Create dedicated location pages and integrate with CMS.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully created a functional HTML5 version of the Maklerzentrum website, initially in , which was later recreated/consolidated under  after the directory went missing. This HTML5 version now dynamically loads content using a local mock-CMS system based on JSON files and custom JavaScript (, , etc.). A basic admin interface () was also created to manage this mock content.

The most recent user interaction provided detailed requirements for legal and compliance features. This included:
1.  **CMS Integration for Legal Texts:** , , and  content should be editable via the CMS.
2.  **Navigation Integration:** Legal links should appear in the footer and a collapsed section of the mobile burger menu, *without* altering the main navigation.
3.  **Consent Banner:** Implementation of an opt-in consent banner for analytics/marketing cookies.
4.  **Security Enhancements:** Adding HTTP security headers, securing admin interfaces, and implementing form security (reCAPTCHA, rate-limiting, PII-free logging).
5.  **SEO/GEO-SEO:** Updating sitemaps/robots, dynamic JSON-LD injection, and potential GEO-specific pages.

In response, the AI engineer has begun implementing these features by:
-   Creating local mock CMS data stores:  and  for legal and navigation data.
-   Creating modular JavaScript files in  for , , , , and  functionalities.
-   Generating the legal HTML pages: , , .
-   Creating security-related files: , and updating/creating  and .
-   Recreating  to integrate the legal navigation elements and CMS.

The immediate state is that the basic structure for the legal/compliance system is in place, and the AI engineer is about to integrate actual content into these pages and implement auto-scrolling.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the Impressum and AGB content 1:1 from  into the CMS mock data and implement auto-scrolling to the top on page changes.
