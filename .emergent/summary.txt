<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory shows a systematic development process for the Maklerzentrum Schweiz AG website, moving from an initial React/FastAPI setup towards a static HTML5 frontend with a local mock-CMS. Key accomplishments include duplicating the original app, a significant effort in porting core pages to HTML5, and implementing a mock CMS for dynamic content. Initial challenges involved correct routing of HTML5 pages and ensuring static assets were served correctly alongside the React development server. The engineer successfully integrated legal content (Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB) and Swiss German texts, and addressed form submission issues by adding backend endpoints. Most recently, the engineer fixed styling and content for  page dates and is now proceeding with the user's request to convert the About us page entirely to HTML5, addressing the overall goal of a fully HTML5 site.

The goal is a fast, mobile-first Swiss German website for Maklerzentrum Schweiz AG to drive VBV course reservations. It requires a sticky header with navigation, Platz sichern CTA, Anmelden link, and a detailed footer. Core pages include Home, Schulung, Services, About Us, Kontakt, Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB, and Danke. Forms (Reservierung, Firmenklasse anfragen) must submit to , with Reservieren buttons on  pre-filling forms. Non-functional requirements cover mobile-first design, SEO (meta, JSON-LD, robots.txt, sitemap), performance, and accessibility. Recent updates demanded CMS-editable legal texts (Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB), legal links in footer/mobile menu, a consent banner, HTTP security headers, form security (reCAPTCHA, rate-limiting, PII-free logging), GEO-SEO features, and page auto-scrolling to the top. All text must be in Schweizer Hochdeutsch (ss instead of ÃŸ). The  page date styling (light gray, bold, single line) was a recent fix. The current explicit request is to convert remaining React pages, starting with About us, to pure HTML5.

Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical bug on the HTML5  page. The user had reported incorrect styling and content for course dates. The previous colorful badges were replaced with a light gray background for the date boxes, and the dates themselves are now displayed in bold font, ensuring each module's dates appear on a single line as requested. All provided course dates, chronologically grouped by month from December 2025 to June 2026, have been accurately integrated into the  page and copied to . This ensures the HTML5 training page correctly displays the schedule and that the Reservieren buttons function as intended, triggering pre-filled booking forms sent to .

Following this fix, the user explicitly requested to begin the 1:1 conversion of the About us page from its current React implementation () to a pure HTML5 page. The AI engineer has initiated this task by creating the new file , ready for content porting. The website currently operates in a hybrid state: the main page and some navigation are still React, while pages like , , , and  are functioning HTML5 pages served statically from .
