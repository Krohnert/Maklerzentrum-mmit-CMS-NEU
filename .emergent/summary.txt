The AI engineer systematically transformed the Maklerzentrum Schweiz AG application from a React/FastAPI hybrid to a pure HTML5 frontend, driven by user requests for performance, SEO, and specific content management. The initial phase involved duplicating the app and porting key legal and  pages to static HTML5. A significant early challenge was correcting  page date display, ensuring alignment and complete data. Following this, the engineer addressed a series of 1:1 React-to-HTML5 conversions for core pages (, , , , , ). A recurring issue during this conversion was ensuring proper routing from React to the new static HTML5 pages and updating navigation links, which was critical to eliminate React flashes. The engineer also implemented new features like a contact form on the  page and updated styling for buttons. Most recently, the core React entry point was removed, making the site functionally React-free. The current task involves a major architectural change: moving the extensive FAQ section from the Home page to the  page and updating its content.

The goal is a fast, mobile-first Swiss German website for Maklerzentrum Schweiz AG to drive VBV course reservations. It requires a sticky header with navigation, specific CTAs, and a detailed footer. Core pages (Home, Schulung, Services, About Us, Kontakt, Impressum, Datenschutz, AGB, Danke) must be developed. Forms (Reservierung, Firmenklasse anfragen) must submit to , with pre-filled forms from Reservieren buttons. Non-functional requirements include mobile-first design, SEO (meta, JSON-LD, robots.txt, sitemap), performance, and accessibility. Recent updates demanded CMS-editable legal texts, footer/mobile menu legal links, a consent banner, HTTP security headers, form security (reCAPTCHA, rate-limiting, PII-free logging), GEO-SEO features, and page auto-scrolling to the top. All text must be in Schweizer Hochdeutsch. The  page dates required a specific light gray, bold, single line styling and complete chronological data. The primary ongoing task is the 1:1 conversion of all remaining React pages to pure HTML5, followed by architectural changes like moving the extensive FAQ to the Schulung page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a significant architectural refactor: moving the extensive FAQ section from the HTML5 Home page () to the HTML5  page (), to be presented as an accordion. The user provided a comprehensive list of new FAQ questions and answers.

The AI engineer successfully:
1.  **Analyzed and removed the old FAQ section** from . This involved identifying the specific HTML block for the FAQ and deleting it.
2.  **Identified the correct placement** on the  page: directly before the Kursanfrage section, as clarified by a user-provided screenshot.
3.  **Inserted the new, extensive FAQ content (HTML structure)** into  at the specified location. This content includes the new questions and answers in a standard accordion HTML structure.

The final action in the trajectory indicates that the AI engineer is now proceeding to add the necessary JavaScript for the FAQ accordion functionality on the  page to make it interactive. This will ensure the FAQ section functions as expected.
